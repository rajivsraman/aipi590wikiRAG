# AIPI 590 Homework 3 - DIY Wikipedia RAG Implementation

The public repository for deploying my Streamlit demo for Homework 3 in AIPI 590: Large Language Models.

## Local Setup

To run the streamlit app locally, just download the app.py script and run **streamlit run app.py**. Also, make sure to install the necessary requirements.

## Publicly Available Application

The fully deployed Streamlit demo can be found here: https://aipi590wikirag.streamlit.app/. Follow these steps to use it:
1. Enter valid Wikipedia article titles into the first field. Repeat this as many times as you'd like with different article titles.
2. Provide a query that is related to the Wikipedia pages you've scraped, either in the form of a question or an open-ended term

The model should output a short and informative response if your prompt is relatively simple.
